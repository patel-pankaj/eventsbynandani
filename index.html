              <p>Nandani worked as our event planner for our wedding, but I always felt like a close family member is planning our wedding. She really knows how to plan an event. We have been planning our wedding with Nandani since one year and from the starting till end, she has been extremely supportive, flexible and energetic.<a class="glow readmore" href="#">...read more</a><span class="more-content">She was ALWAYS available whenever we needed her, whenever we called her, even after normal working hours she was available when we needed to talk with her. She has good connections with all right people/vendors such as DJ, Decorators, Photographers etc that you would need to successfully execute an event. Even though I was flexible with our budget for wedding, she always tried to save wherever we can and we should. She always made sure that we get best deal and never overspend on anything. She knows all little traditional rituals that we have in an Indian wedding and she planned them extremely well with completing them in time and with making sure that we enjoy each of them. After our wedding I can say, planning a wedding event is extremely difficult because there are so many things to consider and they all need proper coordination and attention in order to make wedding successful but Nandani made it really easy. She has her own ideas with that everything was so seamless. I cannot appreciate and express in words how much efforts she gave for our wedding, from starting till end she was working to make our wedding memorable and beautiful, she didn't even care for herself on wedding day, we literally had to force her to take rest. In summary I would say, she is amazing human being, I can't think of a single negative thing about her and her work. I would 1000% recommend her and for all our future  events I am going to work with Nandani, no doubt in that. She is family now. Thank you Nandani, lots of love and appreciation from Tirth & Mauli</span></p>

              <p>Nandani was our day of coordinator and was absolutely wonderful! I could not have imagined planning our wedding celebration without her. We had multiple issues with our venue and Nandani was there to give us reassurance and provide multiple pointers as we tried to resolve those issues.She not only<a class="glow readmore" href="#">...read more</a><span class="more-content"> went out of her way to talk to the venue coordinator, but she also gave us suggestions to make sure we weren't mentally and financially strained as we were finalizing the event details literally the week of the wedding. Nandani will make things happen. She knew the vision we wanted for our wedding events and made sure our vendors were on the same page. We were happy with how everything turned out and can't thank Nandani enough for running everything perfectly that night. She was super responsive--anytime I wanted to chat and our check-ins were great to ensure we were on track and keep me excited throughout a long and weary planning period. Nandani helped me find Anisha Coulture to customize my reception dress, which I still to this day receive multiple compliments. She also helped us get a great deal for our 360 Booth. She is very tuned with local businesses and provides great tips if you need help finding a vendor last minute. She's truly a professional and we highly recommend her to anyone looking for a day of coordinator or planner. Very upfront from the start, she does not hide anything. Nandani provided timelines with hour by hour plays and always had a backup in mind. Our guests were very pleased how our wedding events turned out. We are very lucky we found her and highly recommend her if you need a planner to get stuff done!</span></p>

              <p>We had a wedding of our dreams - and it was made possible only due to the herculean effort of Nandani. We remember meeting Nandani at our home for the first time and noticing her forthright personality right away - it did not take time for us to fully trust her and commend her client-first mindset.<a class="glow readmore" href="#">...read more</a><span class="more-content">The first thing Nandani does is to make you forget that she’s your event planner - she becomes family, connects with your parents and friends along the way, fights with you when you spend more, and sends you late night and early morning texts with super cool ideas that cross her mind and worries more on little things even if you’re okay to compromise. Quickly, she becomes family and remains that way well past the wedding. It’s been close to a month, and we actually talk and text regularly - that’s how close she is (and this is true with most of her clients) 🙂 Nandani helped us plan a very intimate yet elegant Pellikuturu/Pellikoduku ceremony and the perfectionist in her added many fun elements to an otherwise formal event. She bought an additional backdrop from her home, arrived early in the morning, and just owned the place through and through — her efforts helped set the mood for Mehndi later in the evening. Mehndi was in our lovely backyard - she bought a team with her and supercharged the space with decor elements while ensuring that we stuck to the grand theme we envisioned. Nandani went the extra mile and sported her anchor hat! She lightened the mood, hosted games, helped fire up the dance floor, and was an incredible asset in making the night magical! Nandani left at 11PM, only to return to the Wedding venue at 6AM the following day - that’s who she is, she is the master of her craft, and she’s the strength you need on your big day 🙂 Our wedding was absolutely perfect - we envisioned a lake wedding that reflects love and togetherness, and Nandani ensured that the vision turned into an even more surreal reality. She worked with many vendors with absolute professionalism, was always on our side first, and never missed a beat in terms of timelines. Nandani was not our event planner but our best friend. She ensured that everything was on track with regular updates, complemented what we did well, and guided us where our decisions could have led to shortcomings. She even remembered the most minuscule of our asks and delivered everything she promised. As with any wedding, we had hiccups. These were forgettable since we had Nandani handling every hiccup like a true superhero! A vendor bailed on us last minute - Nandani deployed a best-in-class vendor on the same day using her connections and even had a backup to the backup vendor she arranged! We worked with a highly established decor company, and sadly they made an error in measurements. Nandani and I got on a call with them three hours before the wedding, and she ensured we did not compromise on anything when we figured out workarounds. There were a plethora of other things she had to handle. Still, she did such an excellent job in mitigating these hurdles that we did not even know about a majority of these issues at the time of happening - that speaks volumes about who Nandani is. She values not just giving her clients a magical day but ensures that she protects you at all costs from the stress and surprises that would otherwise impact the joys of having a dream wedding. She did this while taking particular notice of our parents and elders - often nudging them to eat and cracking jokes when they were getting emotional. She was hyping up the bride/groom squads if they needed some push while navigating the emotions, ensuring all the vendors were happy and smiling at all times, and SO much more. We have a new definition for multitasking, all thanks to our superhero! Nandani - we are not just lucky to partner with you for the wedding.. we are more fortunate to remain so close to you. Cheers to a beautiful friendship and to the best event planner ever. We love you as much as you love Tamarind Rice, haha 🙂</span>

              <p>Little did we know that the responsibility of a wedding planner is a really big one. Nandani went above and beyond our expectations to make sure that our day was perfect. After having a few productive conversations about planning before our big weekend, we felt absolutely comfortable entrusting her the responsibilities on the day of our wedding.<a class="glow readmore" href="#">...read more</a><span class="more-content">Nandani has an eye for creativity, and is familiar with plenty of trade secrets. She very promptly fixed some last minute unavoidable mishaps which alleviated so much stress during the entire weekend. She made sure we were well fed and were having a good time. It was obvious to all our guests that she has a genuine passion for her work. She treated our family like her own, and was able to anticipate our needs well in advance. My brother in law described her in his speech as the most charming and fearless drill sergeant who WILL get things done. We highly recommend Nandani for any of your event planning needs.</span></p>

              <p>Where do I even begin with Nandani? I happened to meet her at the Avalon on a random site visit. How ironic that I met our future planner at our future wedding venue? From the very beginning, Nandani was very clear about putting our wants and needs first. She was very transparent about her pricing and services,and worked tirelessly<a class="glow readmore" href="#">...read more</a><span class="more-content"> to find us vendors and services within our budget. Throughout the entire planning process, Nandani was there every step of the way. Whether I called or texted her first thing in the morning or at night, I always got a prompt response. Nandani went above and beyond to take things off my plate for me to have less to worry about. I was very Type A during planning, but she always delivered on her promises and took care of everything. The week of the wedding, however, is when she really shone. She became a part of the family. Not only did all of our friends and family adore her, but she found a way to delegate tasks to people, so that we were not worried about anything the weekend of. I honestly don’t even know what or if anything did not go according to the plan the weekend of our wedding, because it was all taken care of by Nandani and her team. She was there early and was the last person to leave every single night. Even weeks after the wedding, I am still texting her asking questions of where certain things may be, and she still responds so promptly. I truly believe we have found a lifelong friend and planner in Nandani, and I highly recommend her for any planning services, but particularly for the most important weekend of your life. She is honest, hard working, and truly puts your needs before all else. She will go to the greatest lengths to make your dreams come true, and will be your biggest cheerleader the weekend of the wedding. Having Nandani be our planner was the easiest decision we made, and it made the rest of our planning process so much easier for. I cannot say enough good things about her, and highly recommend her for all of your planning services. She is truly the best!</span></p>

              <p>Would be an understatement to say that we were blessed to have Nandani as our day of coordinator for our wedding festivities! Went above and beyond in guiding us to the appropriate vendors, going as far as even negotiating with the vendors to ensure we got a good deal. Very easy to approach with such a friendly demeanor,was always available<a class="glow readmore" href="#">...read more</a><span class="more-content"> to answer any of our queries, any time of the day, in the months leading up to our big day. We had a particularly challenging programme to pull off, with back to back events (am wedding, pm reception) 4 hours apart on the same day -- Nandini's attention to detail, organization skills, and vast experience were certainly clutch in executing our events seamlessly and making our vision a reality.  Furthermore, she has a good heart, top notch communication and people skills, and at the same time, has no qualms taking charge of situation when necessary and being the 'bad cop' to keep proceedings running in a timely fashion. Would undoubtedly recommend her services for any events, however big or small!</span></p>

              <p>First of all, let me just say a special thank you to this gem of a woman. I don’t think anything could have have been executed as beautifully as it did without the help of this tiny yet extremely powerful woman. I had booked Nandani back in January and my wedding was in June. From the minute we spoke,<a class="glow readmore" href="#">...read more</a><span class="more-content">she made me feel so comfortable and it’s very hard for me to trust anyone but with her it was effortless. Every contract I signed, every vendor I spoke with, every idea I had, Nandani made sure to address all my needs. She made every family member that was helping feel just as important as well and made every persons requests into reality. We would speak anytime I had a question even if it was in the wee hours of the night. I remember one specific time where I was having a meltdown and she called me that minute and literally calmed me down and made me take a bubble bath to calm my nerves. We had some drama with some of the vendors at one point, but she prepped us before we met with them to discuss and we were able to fix everything. It’s the little things that you don’t think will go wrong that do, and this is when Nandani comes into play. This woman has become a family member to me. Like a sister and friend and mother all in one. She contacted every vendor that she knew that I booked, before I even met them to ensure I was getting the best deal and no one tried to cheat their way with me because they knew they had Nandani to report to after! She helped me choose small things like my party favors and family gifts and even my makeup looks! I could count on her for anything guys. During the sangeet she made sure I ate and reminded me to take my medicine on time. She took me to the bathroom herself. She had water for me and fruits for me when I was taking pix in the heat. During the reception she made sure I was comfortable and ate…writing this is making me teary because I was her responsibility and she made sure that I was okay for every event. I love her with all my being and I 100% recommended her!! She is amazing and you will not be disappointed! She called me the day after the wedding to make sure I was okay, which touched me even more. Love her and trust me, you will too!</span></p>
